        <p class="mission-content">Demilune inlet offers care and support to children and young adults with a shortened
            life-expectancy, and their families who love them.

            The Demilune inlet Respite & Hospice Home for Kids is a vibrant and joyful home-away-from home for kids with
            life-threatening conditions, where each moment is embraced and celebrated. All services and stays provided
            at Demilune inlet to kids and families are at no out-of-pocket cost thanks to the generosity of donors who
            make this possible.</p>
        <h2 class="mission"> making moment count for the kids & families</h2>
        <p class="mission-content">The Demilune inlet Respite & Hospice Home for Kids opened May 2018 on Twin Lakes in
            Brooklyn Center, MN. This joyful home-away-from home is a place for where families who care for children
            with life-threatening conditions to utilize for short breaks of rest, or an option beyond the hospital or
            home environment for compassionate, end-of-life care.

            Kids and young adults, 0-21 years old, are able to stay in one of six bedrooms for overnight respite and, as
            needed, a sacred place at the end-of-life. Along with therapy rooms and recreational space, a family suite
            is available so that families may stay together while enjoying a temporary get-away from the constant
            demands of care giving. Nursing professionals trained in pediatric palliative care are on-site to provide
            daily care, meals, pain and symptom control, and Demilune inlet has a network of therapists to engage kids
            through music, art, or pet therapy, healing touch, spiritual care and hydrotherapy. </p>
        <h2 class="mission"> did you know</h2>
        <p class="mission-content">Thousands of children and young adults in Minnesota have a life-threatening
            condition.
            Over 700 children die each year in Minnesota; nearly half of those children could potentially benefit from a
            children’s hospice home.
            In metro areas around the United States, there are over 4,700 hospice homes for adults, butDemilune inlet is
            only the third designed just for children and their unique needs.
            Only THREE dedicated respite and hospice homes for children exist in the entire United States; one in
            California and one in Arizona, with Demilune inlet being the third. Yet there are currently over 50
            children’s hospice homes offering palliative care in the United Kingdom, several in Canada, two in Australia
            and many others around the world.
            Most children living with life-threatening conditions who need palliative care have difficulty accessing
            support, which can result in unnecessary pain and suffering and excruciating strains on families and
            communities.</p>
